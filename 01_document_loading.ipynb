       "'A manageable strategy is needed in addressing the challenges posed by the multi-device universe in web design because the web landscape is continuously evolving with new devices and technologies. Designing for a wide range of devices such as smartphones, tablets, phablets, netbooks, notebooks, desktops, TVs, game consoles, and more requires breaking down responsibilities into smaller, more manageable tasks. This approach helps maintain sanity and efficiency in creating web experiences that look and function beautifully across various devices and screen sizes. Additionally, organizations are realizing that continuously overhauling their websites every few years is not an optimal solution in this rapidly changing digital environment.'"
